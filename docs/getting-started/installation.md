# Getting started

This section will lead you all the way from installation to implementation in a few easy steps.

## Installation
### From PyPI

Bowline can be installed with `pip`:
```
$ pip install bowline
```
This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies. [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). Bowline always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.

### From GitHub
Bowline can be directly used from [GitHub](https://github.com/mgancita/bowline) by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you want to use the very latest version:
```
git clone https://github.com/mgancita/bowline.git
```

**This may contain un-released features so use at your own risk.**
