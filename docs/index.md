*Bowline* is a set of configurable tools to easily preprocess your data for data science and machine learning. If you're familiar with Python, you can install Bowline with pip, the Python package manager.

Note that Bowline currently only supports Python 3.7+.

## Why the name?
With raw datasets typically being messy and hard to "wrangle", I decided to name this set of tools after the **bowline** knot.
